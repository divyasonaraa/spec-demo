# Vue3 Composition API + <script setup> + TypeScript. NO Options API.

This repository demonstrates the use of Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax and TypeScript. It avoids the Options API entirely for a cleaner and more modern approach.

## Features

- **TypeScript Support**: Strongly typed props, emits, and components.
- **Composition API**: Simplified and modular code structure.
- **Reusable Base Components**: Includes base components like `BaseInput`, `BaseTextarea`, `BaseCheckbox`, `BaseRadio`, and `BaseButton`.
- **Scoped Styles**: Ensures styles are encapsulated within components.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/vue3-composition-api-typescript.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Start the development server:
